# Base2Tone-For-Obsidian.md
A theme for Obsidian based on http://base2t.one/ with default hues from http://simurai.com/duotone-dark-sky-syntax/

![Colours](./colours.gif)

## Instructions
1. Download obsidian.css to your Obsidian vault folder.
2. In Obsidian, click Settings->Plugins and turn on "Custom CSS".
3. If you want to change your colours, just change the two hue values at the top of the file (`--uno` and `--duo`)

### Exception
At the moment there is one colour value (marked `--D0-rgb`) which requires a little extra work.  
You will need to convert the `--baseD0` colour (`hsl(--duo, 58%, 55%)`) to RGB using something like https://convertacolor.com/

## Licence
I don't really care what happens to this theme, so I put it under [The Unlicense](./LICENSE) and set it free!
